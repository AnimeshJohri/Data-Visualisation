I Collected and visualized the data related to my life and the phenomenon around me. This data was related to the following phenomenon:
1.	Science 
Measured the rate of my weekly weight loss for 9 weeks
2.	Business 
Measure of the Starbucks customer traffic throughout the day for Espresso
3.	General Observation (Neither Science nor Business)
I Recorded my credit score after each week V/S the balance of credit card at that time.

I collected and visualized the data using excel. I have listed minimum three insights using data table, graph and color-coded data table. I Checked for any patterns, relationships, groupings, trends or outliers and make insights out of it.
