Web Scrapping: It is a technique of extracting information from websites using computer software or applications

Objective: To develop skills for acquiring/scrapping website's data using a Python technique. 
Website Scrapped: - https://weather.com/weather/today/l/USTX1110:1:US
Tools Used: Excel, Python, Notepad++, Command line Interface
Dependencies and Packages Used: Beautiful Soup toolkit, Easy_install python module

Process:

1.Firstly, I moved to the "script" folder under "Python36" folder inside the "c drive" using the command line to install "easy_install requests". 
2."Easy_install requests" is a python module bundled with setuptools that lets us automatically download, build, install, and manage Python packages.
3. Secondly, I downloaded "Beautifulsoup4" package and installed "lxml library" using the commands "easy_install BeautifulSoup4" and "pip install lxml" respectively. 
4. The Requests library will open the URL, download the HTML and pass it to BeautifulSoup.
5. Python’s BeautifulSoup toolkit is used to parse the site’s HTML and extract the data. 
6. All libraries for scrapping data was installed and scrapping code was run to obtain a CSV containing the scrapped data. 

Analysis and visualization on the scrapped data is available in the attached pdf and excel sheet.
